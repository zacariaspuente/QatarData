        "description": "From the very first tournament onward, Argentina have boasted a rich history in the World Cup. With two winners' medals and two further appearances in the final, few teams have made such an impact on the competition as the Albiceleste.Naturally enough then, picking the side's greatest moments from 1930 to 2010—a period of no less than 80 years—is never going to be an easy task. From their greatest wins to their cruelest heartbreaks, and including in the middle some of the greatest goals ever to bless the painted lines of a football pitch, here are 30 of the most memorable moments of the Argentine national team."

The Mexico national team, along with Brazil are the only two nations to make it out of the group stage over the last seven World Cups.[3] Mexico played France in the first match of the first World Cup on 13 July 1930. Mexico's best progression in World Cups has been reaching the quarter-finals in both the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, both of which were staged on Mexican soil. Mexico is historically the most successful national team in the CONCACAF region, having won eleven confederation titles, including eight CONCACAF Gold Cups and three CONCACAF Championships (the precursor to the Gold Cup), as well as two NAFC Championships, one North American Nations Cup, one CONCACAF Cup and two gold medals of the Central American and Caribbean Games. It is one of eight nations[a] to have won two of the three most important football tournaments (the World Cup, Confederations Cup, and Summer Olympics), having won the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup[4] and the 2012 Summer Olympics.[5] Mexico is also the only team from CONCACAF to have won an official FIFA competition, winning the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup. Although Mexico is under the jurisdiction of CONCACAF, the national team was regularly invited to compete in the Copa América from 1993 to 2016, finishing runner-up twice – in 1993 and 2001 – and obtaining the third-place medal on three occasions."

Saudi Arabia is the first AFC nation to reach the final of a senior FIFA competition, when it achieved during the 1992 King Fahd Cup, which would eventually become the eventual FIFA Confederations Cup. Only Australia and Japan managed to repeat this feat, in 1997 and 2001, though Australia achieved it when it was a member of the OFC. In the 1994 World Cup, under the leadership of Jorge Solari, Saudi Arabia beat both Belgium and Morocco in the group stage before falling to Sweden in the Round of 16. Thus Saudi Arabia became the second Arab national football team in history to reach the Round of 16 in a World Cup, after Morocco's Round of 16 elimination in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, and one of the few Asian national football teams (others being Australia, Japan, South Korea, North Korea) to accomplish such a feat to date."
